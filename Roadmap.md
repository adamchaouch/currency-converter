# Currency Converter - Technical Debt and Improvements

## Application Containerization

Creating an optimized Dockerfile using a multi-stage build approach would allow us to minimize the final image size. The build process should be structured with:
- A build stage containing all development dependencies and build tools
- A production stage containing only the necessary runtime files
- Proper caching mechanisms to optimize build time

Setting up a comprehensive docker-compose configuration would facilitate both development and production environments. This should include:
- Development environment with hot-reloading capabilities
- Volume mapping for efficient local development
- Environment variable management for different deployment contexts

## Multi-Currency Support

The current EUR/USD-only implementation needs to be expanded to support multiple currencies. This improvement requires:

Data Structure Enhancements:
- Implementation of a cross-rate calculation engine
- Efficient storage and retrieval of exchange rates
- Management of rate update frequencies for different pairs

## Backend Development
- Implementation of a Node.js/Express backend server
- Setup of a PostgreSQL database for data persistence
- Development of RESTful APIs for:
  * User management (registration, authentication)
  * Conversion history storage and retrieval
  * Exchange rate management
  * User preferences storage


## Testing Infrastructure

Unit Tests:
- Component rendering and behavior validation
- Exchange rate calculation accuracy
- State management testing
- Event handling verification
