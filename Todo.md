# Critical Improvement Points

1. The lack of unit and integration tests compromises the reliability of conversion calculations and application stability for future updates.

2. Error handling remains basic, particularly for edge cases in conversions and situations where the exchange rate could become invalid.

3. The user interface doesn't include sufficient visual feedback during exchange rate updates, which can create confusion about the system's current state.

4. The application doesn't implement a data persistence system, meaning conversion history and user preferences are lost upon page refresh.
